        <p>Max. performance 120 KV/5 mA/600 Watt.
        <br><br>End grounded water cooled metal ceramic X-ray tube with 1.5 x 1.5 mm (optional 0.4 x 0.4 mm) focal spot and inherent filtration 1 mm Be. Can be delivered with different kinds of collimator systems, such as pencil beam or fan-beam geometry
        <br><br>Complete X-ray source integrated into one block with control, HT generation and X-ray tube. Versatile mains input, microprocessor control with RS422 serial interface, interlocks and warning lamps output. The whole housing is internally shielded with Pb and the leak dose is under 0.75 mR/hr with closed beam port. The MB120 X-ray source is typical used for integration in high performance industrial measuring and material analysis systems, where very high output dose stability is required. <a href="Contact.php">Go to Contact <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i></a></p>
