        <p>Max. performance 120 KV/5 mA/600 Watt.
        <br>End grounded water cooled metal ceramic X-ray tube with 1.5 x 1.5 mm (optional 0.4 x 0.4 mm) focal spot and inherent filtration 1 mm Be. Can be delivered with different kinds of collimator systems; cone beam or fan-beam geometry.
        <br>Complete X-ray source integrated into one block with control, HT generation and X-ray tube. Versatile mains input, microprocessor control with RS422 serial interface, interlocks and warning lamps output. The whole housing is internally shielded with Pb and the leak dose is &lt; 10 µSv/hr with closed beam port. The MB120 X-ray source is typical used for integration in high performance industrial measuring and material analysis systems, where very high output dose stability is required.  
        <br><br>Weight: approx. 52 Kg</p>
